// Server Side Maprotations...
// WARNING: You can NOT use CubeScript in here!!

// Use the following scheme...
// map:mode:time:allowVote[:minplayer[:maxplayer[:skiplines]]]
// map will be skipped, if minplayer/maxplayer requirements are failed

// map: map filename without extension
//      do only use standard maps and maps from your packages/maps/servermaps folder
//      for the flag modes (5, 14 & 15), be sure, the map contains flag bases

// mode: Team Deathmatch (0), Deathmatch (2), Pistol Frenzy (6), Team Pistol Frenzy (16),
//       Capture the Flag (5), Hunt the Flag (13), Keep the Flag (15), Team Keep the Flag (14),

// vote: (1) allow players to vote for other maps
//       (0) only admin can change the map

// minplayer: if set, the server will skip the map, if fewer than required players are connected

// maxplayer: if set, the server will skip the map, if more than allowed players are connected

// skiplines: lines to skip in maprot.cfg, after this map got actually played
//            this can be used to select one of several lines, instead of playing all lines

// minplayer and maxplayer numbers are only checked when a new game is picked from the map rotation.
// If the player number changes during gameplay, no action will be taken.
